\begin{enumerate}[a]
	\item %a
	I used "x / y" to indicate that x was received and y was sent.
	For A this means: received acknowledgement for packet x and sent packet y.
	For B this means: received packet x and sent acknowledgement for packet y.

		\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\textbf{Comparison}}\\\hline
		Protocol & GBN & SR & TCP\\\hline
		\hline
		Packets sent by A & 10 & 7 & 7\\
		ACKs sent by B & 9 & 6 & 6\\\hline
	\end{tabular}

	For the sequence numbers of the packets and ACKS refer to the diagrams above.
	\item %b
	TCP would deliver all data segments in the shortest time interval because of the fast retransmit that is built into it. After 3 duplicate ACKs the sender will retransmit the packet after the last one it has received an ACK for. This happens regardless of the timeout value.

	Neither GBN nor SR have such a mechanic and only retransmit packets after the timeout has run out. This means with a long timeout it will take much time before the missing packet is retransmitted.

\section{} %3
\begin{enumerate}[a]
	\item %a
	This is TCP Tahoe because at 14 a new slow start phase is started. Reno would skip this phase.
	\item %b
	The slow start is operating from 1-4 and from 14. It can be identified by the exponential speed increase.
	\item %c
	In the congestion avoidance phase the $cwnd$ (congestion window) is linearly increasing. This happens between 4-8 and 9-13.
	\item %d
	On slide 48 is says that if you are in congestion avoidance mode (which we are at 13) and you receive 3 duplicate ACKs then you go into fast recovery mode. Because at 14 the slow start begins again we can assume that at 13 a timeout happened.
	\item %e
	The $ssthresh$ is initially set to 8 because that it when the slow start phase ends.
	\item %f
	The $ssthresh$ at 8 should be set to half of what it is, so to 6. If you look at the graph however the $ssthresh$ seems to be set to 9 instead because that is where fast recovery picks up.
	\item %g
	The $ssthresh$ is set to half the current $cwnd$ after 13, which is $6$. Because at 15 the $cwnd$ is at 2 and $2^2 = 4 \leq 6$, the $cwnd$ at 16 is 4.
	\item %h
	Both values are set to half the current $cwnd$, which is 1. The $ssthresh$ and $cwnd$ would both be set to 1.
	\item %i
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
		Round & Packets send & Total\\\hline
		1 & 1 & 1\\
		2 & 2 & 3\\
		3 & 4 & 7\\
		4 & 8 & 15\\
		5 & 9 & 24\\
	\end{tabular}

	The 17th segment is send somewhere within the 5th round.
